Research based on Breast Cancer Disease diagnosis and treatment of Haematoxylin & Eosin Images with the help of Image Classification and Translation.
Breast cancer is the driving cause of cancer-related
passings among women around the world. This research explores
the use of deep learning models in Breast cancer diagnosis and
treatment using Hematoxylin and Eosin recolored histopatho-
logical images. Hematoxylin and Eosin images are used to
examine breast cancer tissue sections. These images, which are
microscopic and color-coded, aid in identifying cellular and tissue
components.
Image Classification performed on CNN and Transfer Learning Models such as Vision Transformers using BreakHis Dataset.
Image Generation/Translation performed on Autoencoders,Pyramidpix2pix and CycleGans Models using Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical Dataset.
